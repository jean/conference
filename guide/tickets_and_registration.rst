Tickets and Registration
========================

Depending on the size of your event and whether or not you will be charging a fee, 
you may or may not choose to use ticketing and registration. 

Registration
------------

Registration options vary from simple spreadsheets and forms to online applications
dedicated to event registration. 

* Google spreadsheet and Form: Probably one of the simplest forms of registration
  available. Create a Google Form and send the information to a Google Spreadsheet.
  This method is very easy and simple to setup and maintain, but it is also very
  "primitive" and basic. Although this method is free, it will not work if you
  plan on charging a registration fee.
  
* Web-based event registration application such as `Eventbrite`_ or `Eventzilla`_. These
  applications obviously excel at attendee registration, as this is what they are 
  made for. If your event is free, use of these services is typically free as well.
  For paid events, the registration provider typically charges a small 
  percentage-based fee. The fee can either be explicitly tacked onto the cost of 
  registration or the organizer can just up their registration fee to make the 
  provider fee invisible to the attendee. Providers such as Eventbrite or
  Eventzilla also provide widgets and code that conference organizers can embed 
  into a page on the conference web site.
